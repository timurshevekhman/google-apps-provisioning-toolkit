## PROJECT OVERVIEW ##

The objective of the Open Source Google Apps Provisioning Toolkit is to provide a browser-based interface for creating and updating user accounts in Google Apps. It also happens to be very fast at provisioning accounts - averaging 20 account creations per second.

**The toolkit can be configured to address two common use cases:**

  1. Bulk provisioning or updating user accounts from information stored in a CSV, LDAP, or SQL data source.
  1. Providing a web page where users can self-register with Google Apps, after optionally first authenticating against an existing user data store (e.g. SAML-based SSO, LDAP, or SQL).
