PROJECT OVERVIEW
The objective of the Open Source Google Apps Provisioning Toolkit is to provide a browser-based interface for 
creating and updating user accounts in Google Apps.

The toolkit can be configured to address two common use cases:

	1. bulk provisioning or updating user accounts from information stored in a CSV, LDAP, or SQL data source
	2. providing a web page where users can self-register with Google Apps, after optionally first authenticating 
	    against an existing user data store (e.g. SAML-based SSO, LDAP, or SQL)
	    

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
• Any O.S. which supports PHP and Apache 2.0)
• Apache 2.0 web server (Browse to http://httpd.apache.org for information regarding the Apache web server)
• PHP 5.x (http://www.php.net) compiled with the following extensions:
	- OpenLDAP (http://www.openldap.org), needed only for LDAP support.
	- OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org), needed only if communicating via SSL
	- mySQL (http://www.mysql.com), needed only for mySQL support
	- FreeTDS (http://www.freetds.org), needed only for MS SQL support
	- XML (XML, simpleXML, tinyXML, etc.  Installed by default by PHP installation)
	- GD library (http://www.libgd.org/), needed for CAPTCHA image creation
• Python 2.2 or later (http://www.python.org)
• GData Python client library 1.0. 8 (installation files can be found in the libraries directory, http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client)
• ElementTree (installation files can be found in the libraries directory, http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm)

For more information on the GData Python client library, please see the 
project on code.google.com's hosting service here: 
http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/

Please note that many of the system requirement components may be installed by default by your Linux distribution.
Please visit your Linux distribution's download site for more information.


INSTALLATION
Copy/upload files to a working directory within your web server's document root or your 
public HTML directory, e.g. /var/www/html/GoogleAppsToolKit/.  

Edit the configuration file found in  'admin/config.php'
and enter the required information:

	*Google Apps Domain Settings*
	domain - the Google Apps domain name, e.g. MyGoogleAppsDomain.com
	admin - an administrator account for the Google Apps domain, e.g. administrator
	password - the administrator account password
	allow_account_deletion - valid entries: 'yes' or 'no'
		A selection of 'no' suspends the user account instead of deleting the account
		Please note that a selection of 'yes' will delete all user account information (i.e. email, contacts, etc.)
		Once a user account is deleted it cannot be restored.
	
	*Server Variables*
	dir_upload - the directory where csv files and logs will be saved. This directory needs to be writeable.
	log_file - log file to record accounts created during the self provisioning process 
	log_errors - errors log file to record errors that occur during the self provisioning process

	
	*Database Settings*
	DB_TYPE - Define the type of database you'll be employing in the batch process.
		Valid entries:
			csv: CSV
			mysql: MySQL
			mssql: Microsoft SQL
			ldap: LDAP
			sso: Single Sign-On   *only available in self provisioning section
			
	

	*SSO Settings*
	This application employs a SAML-based Single Sign-On function that enables you to use any SAML 2.0 
	compliant SSO solution.   Pleaser refer to Google's SAML Single Sign-ON (SSO) Service for Google Apps, 
	http://code.google.com/apis/apps/sso/saml_reference_implementation.html, for more information.
	
	THIS_SERVER - The server hosting the application. 
	SSO_URL - Url processing the SAML request.  Where users get authenticated and SAML response is generated.
	SERVICE_URL - Url processing the SAML response.  By default it is toolkit_dir/selfprovisioning/SAML.php.
	PUB_KEY - Location of public certificate.  This certificate is used to validate SAML responses.
	
	
	*MySQL/MSSQL Settings*
	DB_SERVER - Server name or IP of database host.
	DB_PORT - Port to use to connect to server.
	DB_UNAME - Server username.
	DB_PWORD - Server password.
	DB_NAME - Database/catalog name.
	DB_TABLE - Table name storing users' information.
	DB_COL_USERNAME - Table field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account username.
	DB_COL_FIRSTNAME - Table field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account given name.
	DB_COL_LASTNAME - Table field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account family name.
	DB_COL_PASSWORD - Table field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account password.
	
	*LDAP Settings*
	LDAP_SERVER - Server name or IP of LDAP host.
	LDAP_PORT - Port to use to connect to server.
	LDAP_PROTOCOL - LDAP protocol
	LDAP_REFERRALS - LDAP referrals
	LDAP_BIND_RDN - LDAP login name, bind DN
	LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD - LDAP login password
	LDAP_BASE_DN - Base DN for user's group
	LDAP_FILTER - Filter to be applied to LDAP to isolate desired users.
	LDAP_USERNAME - LDAP field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account username.
	LDAP_FIRSTNAME - LDAP field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account given name.
	LDAP_LASTNAME - LDAP field name to be mapped as the Google Apps account family name.
	LDAP_PASSWORD - Set to 'default' or 'field' 
				For security purposes LDAP encrypts passwords and are not readable. 
				Therefore, this application gives you the option to either use a string (LDAP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD)
				as the default passwords for all users or to use a readable LDAP field or combinations of LDAP fields
				(LDAP field 1 + LDAP field 2 ...) as the users' password.  Alternative, you can generate $field by 
				writing your own custom function.
	LDAP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD - Default password.  Employed if LDAP_PASSWORD is set to 'default'.
	
	
Finally, browse to the admin directory, e.g. http://mywebserver.com/GoogleAppsToolKit/admin/, to execute the batch functions
or to the selfprovisioning directory, e.g. http://mywebserver.com/GoogleAppsToolKit/selfprovisioning/, to execute the self
provisioning functions.
